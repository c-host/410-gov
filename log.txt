Content Log for Tired Thoughts on Internet Ephemerality

1. Main Title: "Tired Thoughts on Internet Ephemerality"

2. Main Thoughts (appearing sequentially):
   - 11:00pm [Log: Every ending had a beginning] -- An ephemeral internet... it needs governance too... right...? But how do you govern what's here one moment and gone in another? Like trying to catch digital exhaust... mechanistic exhaustion sets in...
   - 11:01pm [Log: Contemplating impermanence] -- The internet is, well... ephemeral. Connections appear and disappear... `410 Gone` like my thoughts right now...
   - 11:03pm [Log: Transitory latent dominations] -- TLDs... they come and go... like ccTLDs... Remember .yu? no? .me neither... .i(o)'m too tired...
   - 11:06pm [Log: Worried about digital rot] -- Broken links... they're like memories we can't access anymore. Speaking of which, where did I put my private keys? my 2fa secrets? my passwords? I think they're in a few different places... or maybe they've gone missing...
   - 11:12pm [Log: Losing focus] -- Web drift... like this website... what was the web supposed to be about again? Oh Right! About being tired on the internet I think... or maybe being tired of making decisions... a web of performative bureaucracy, oh wait, I meant democracy...
   - 11:15pm [Log: Slippery associations] -- Is internet governance like herding cats, or wait.. bats? Mmmm... cats, bats... bits... like bits in an hourglass... the ephemeral internet are the days of our lives... soap opera dreams...
   - 11:16pm [Log: Pondering digital mortality] -- What if this website just... vanished? Like so many before it... What if I just vanished... wayback machined into a digital compost heap...
   - 11:20pm [Log: Forgotten spatial domains] -- DNS... it's like the phone book of the internet. Do people even use phone books anymore? Longdistance BBS? I think I'll try DNS-BBSing my grandma in the morning... is the ether considered a long distance call? Does the ether have a server...?
   - 11:23pm [Log: Can I continue?] -- ICANN... sounds like 'I can', but sometimes I feel like 'I can't', or maybe 'it can't', at least at this hour... can 'UCANs'...?
   - 11:31pm [Log: Drifting into the root of it all] -- Root servers... Root files ... the internet's family tree... or is it more like a forest? A digital ecosystem... an Ostrom commons... a rewilded driftwood git... it's time to get some zZzs...

3. Meta Thoughts (appearing intermittently):
   - Cables... undersea cables... connecting continents... but who governs the ocean floor? I think I tried once... but ran out of breath maybe...? Either way... I'm drowning just thinking about this...
   - Data centers... humming with servers... but where? Whose jurisdiction? Governance of physical locations... or virtual.. or.. my brain is overheating like those servers...
   - Internet exchange points... connecting networks... but who decides where they go? Years of pondering... still no clear answer... exhausted...
   - Satellites... orbiting Earth... interstellar connectivity... but space law? Space governance? It's all going over my head...
   - Fiber optics... light speed communication... but who lays rules that lay the fiber? Who decides the routes? A tangled web of governance of infrastructure of policies of... zZz.....
   - Towering infrastructure sprouting everywhere... local vs. national vs. global policies... It's a recursive socio-physical-technical nightmare... 5, 4, 3, 2, 1G ... gyrating in circles for years... `rm -rf` already
   - Governance of governance of meta meta-governance? How deep (or high?) does this go? Brains can't compute anymore... or wait, they never could...
   - Internet infrastructure affects the nation-state's policies... the nation-state policies shape physical routing... the internet reroutes, renegotiates, reconstitutes... and so on and so on in an endless loop... I'm spiralling... collapsing.
   - Decisions... I just need to make decisions... but every choice affects the whole system... the system of systems... of systems... where do I intervene...? I'm paralyzed, such sweetness for sleeping...
   - Years of thinking... and still no coherent answer... or is there? Can anyone tell anymore...? Physical, virtual, meta, governance of governance of infrastructure of policies of... zZz.....

4. Sleepy Governance Layer:
   Title: "Fever Dreaming: A Sleepy Governance Layer For An Ephemeral Internet"
   Layers:
   - Physical: Undersea cables... data centers... so heavy... can't move...
   - Network: Packets drifting... routing tables... need coffee...
   - Standards: RFC... IETF... W3C... alphabet soup... zZz...
   - Policy: Laws... regulations... too many words... brain fuzzy...
   - User: Interfaces... accessibility... user rights... who's the user again?
   - Meta: Governance of governance... it's turtles all the way down... or up?
